    - current_occupancy, utilization_rate properties

# New TaskAssignment Model
class TaskAssignment:
    - employee, location, task_type, assigned_date
    - start_time, end_time, is_completed, notes
    - created_by, created_at, updated_at

# New LocationMovement Model
class LocationMovement:
    - employee, from_location, to_location, timestamp
    - movement_type, duration_minutes, notes
    - created_by

# New LocationAnalytics Model
class LocationAnalytics:
    - location, date, current_occupancy, peak_occupancy
    - average_occupancy, utilization_rate
    - total_movements, arrivals, departures
    - active_tasks, completed_tasks, average_stay_duration
    - peak_hours
```

### Database Schema
- **15 locations** (including existing + new locations)
- **12 event types** (including new location tracking events)
- **806 task assignments** imported from Excel
- **808 location movements** imported from Excel
- **52 employees** with location assignments

### Data Import Results
```
ðŸ“Š Import Statistics:
  - Processed sheets: 27
  - Total assignments: 806
  - Total movements: 808
  - Unique employees: 52
  - Unique locations: 5
  - Date range: June 20 - July 30, 2025
  - Completeness: 64.3% (27/42 days)
  - Average daily assignments: 29.9
```

## Location Tracking Features
