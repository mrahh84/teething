# Phase 2: Database Schema Updates - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully extended the Django models for enhanced location tracking and created all necessary database migrations.

## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ Extended Location Model
- **Added location types**: SECURITY, WORKSTATION, LUNCH, MEETING, STORAGE, TASK, ROOM
- **Added capacity tracking**: Maximum number of employees per location
- **Added active status**: Track whether locations are currently active
- **Added descriptions**: Detailed descriptions for each location
- **Added timestamps**: Created and updated timestamps
- **Added properties**: Current occupancy and utilization rate calculations

### ✅ Created New Models

#### TaskAssignment Model
- **Purpose**: Track employee task assignments at specific locations
- **Key fields**: Employee, location, task type, assigned date, start/end times
- **Features**: Completion tracking, notes, created by tracking
- **Indexes**: Optimized for employee, location, task type, and completion queries

#### LocationMovement Model
- **Purpose**: Track employee movements between locations
- **Key fields**: Employee, from/to locations, timestamp, movement type
- **Movement types**: Task Assignment, Break, Lunch, Meeting, Security Check, Clock In/Out
- **Features**: Duration tracking, notes, created by tracking
- **Indexes**: Optimized for employee, location, and movement type queries

#### LocationAnalytics Model
- **Purpose**: Aggregated analytics data for locations
- **Key metrics**: Occupancy, utilization, movements, tasks, performance
- **Features**: Peak hours analysis, average stay duration
- **Indexes**: Optimized for location, date, and utilization queries

### ✅ Database Migrations
- **Migration 0014**: Created new models and extended Location model
- **Migration 0015**: Added timestamp fields to Location model with proper defaults
- **All migrations applied successfully**: No conflicts or errors

### ✅ Event Types Created
- **8 new event types**: Task Assignment, Task Completion, Location Entry/Exit, Break Start/End, Meeting Start/End
- **Total event types**: 12 (including existing Clock In/Out, Check In/Out)

### ✅ Location Types Created
- **9 new locations**: Based on Excel analysis
- **Task locations**: Goobi, OCR4All, Transkribus, Research, VERSA
- **Room locations**: MetaData, IT Suite, BC100, Meeting Room
- **Total locations**: 15 (including existing locations)

## Technical Details

### Model Relationships
```
Employee → TaskAssignment → Location
Employee → LocationMovement → Location (from/to)
Location → LocationAnalytics (daily analytics)
Event → Location (existing relationship)
```

### Database Indexes
- **Location**: location_type + is_active, is_active + name
- **TaskAssignment**: employee + assigned_date, location + assigned_date, task_type + assigned_date
- **LocationMovement**: employee + timestamp, from_location + timestamp, to_location + timestamp
- **LocationAnalytics**: location + date, date + utilization_rate, location + utilization_rate

### Data Validation
- **Unique constraints**: Employee + location + assigned_date for TaskAssignment
- **Unique constraints**: Location + date for LocationAnalytics
- **Foreign key constraints**: All relationships properly defined
- **Choice fields**: Movement types and location types with predefined choices

## Testing Results

### ✅ Model Creation Tests
- **TaskAssignment**: Successfully created and deleted test assignments
- **LocationMovement**: Successfully created and deleted test movements
- **LocationAnalytics**: Successfully created and deleted test analytics

### ✅ Property Tests
- **Location.current_occupancy**: Returns correct count of employees at location
- **Location.utilization_rate**: Calculates percentage correctly
- **Location.is_active**: Returns boolean status correctly

### ✅ Database Integrity
- **Foreign keys**: All relationships working correctly
- **Unique constraints**: Preventing duplicate entries
- **Indexes**: Optimizing query performance
- **Migrations**: Applied without errors

## Integration Points

### With Existing System
- **Event model**: Extended to support new location tracking events
- **Employee model**: Enhanced with task assignments and movements
- **Location model**: Extended with capacity and analytics
- **EmployeeAnalytics**: Already includes location metrics

### API Integration Ready
- **REST endpoints**: Can be added for new models
- **Serializers**: Can be created for new models
- **Views**: Can be extended for location tracking

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
1. **Data Import Scripts**: Create management commands for Excel data import
2. **Employee Matching**: Match Excel employee names with database records
3. **Location Assignment**: Create task assignments from Excel data
4. **Data Validation**: Validate imported data integrity
5. **Import Reports**: Generate import validation reports

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ All new models created and migrated
- ✅ Existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ Test data successfully created and validated
- ✅ Database schema updated without conflicts
- ✅ All models tested and working correctly
