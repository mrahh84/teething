   - Search: name, code, description

2. **AnalyticsCacheAdmin**
   - List display: cache_key, cache_type, created_at, expires_at, is_expired
   - Filters: cache_type, created_at, expires_at
   - Custom is_expired boolean field

3. **ReportConfigurationAdmin**
   - List display: user, report_type, created_at, updated_at
   - Filters: report_type, created_at, updated_at
   - Search: user username, email

4. **EmployeeAnalyticsAdmin**
   - List display: employee, date, total_events, total_hours_worked, attendance_score, is_anomaly
   - Filters: date, is_anomaly, is_late_arrival, is_early_departure
   - Date hierarchy for easy navigation

5. **DepartmentAnalyticsAdmin**
   - List display: department, date, total_employees, present_employees, average_attendance_rate
